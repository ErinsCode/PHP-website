            <h1>WELCOME TO THE BIG OUTSIDE</h1>
            <p> Hello, my name is Michael.  After many years as the Mountain West Editor and primary gear reviewer at Outdoor magazine, 
                I created Outdoors for All with a simple mission: to offer stories, images, and expert trip-planning 
                and gear advice on America&apos;s and the worldâ€™s best hiking, backpacking and other outdoor adventures. </p>  
            <h1>EXPERT TRIP PLANNING</h1>
            <p> I&apos;ve made a living identifying, planning, and writing about great backpacking 
                and hiking trips. Tap into my expertise and save yourself valuable time, hassle,
                and worry. </p>
