            <p> Hello, my name is Michael. <br>
                After many years as the Mountain West Editor and primary gear reviewer at Outdoor magazine, 
                I created Outdoors for All with a simple mission: to offer stories, images, and expert trip-planning 
                and gear advice on America’s and the world’s best hiking, backpacking and other outdoor adventures. </p>  
            <h2>EXPERT TRIP PLANNING</h2>
            <p> I’ve made a living identifying, planning, and writing about great backpacking 
                and hiking trips. Tap into my expertise and save yourself valuable time, hassle,
                and worry. </p>
